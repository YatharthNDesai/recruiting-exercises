- Some assumptions have been made to solve this problem : 
1) It has been assumed that a shipment can be ordered for more than one item.
2) If an order is incomplete, only those items will be removed that are incomplete. Items that are complete will still be shipped e.g,
 Input = {apple: 5, mango: 3}, [{name: 1, inventory: {apple: 4, mango: 3}]
 Output = {1: {mango: 3}

- Jest has been used to perform unit tests.
- As required, the source code is in src folder and tests are in test folder.
